# OF Catch Probability Model
Random forest model created to find the probability of a catch in baseball.
This model was created for submission in the 2023 SMT Data Challenge.
We used the location of the catch and hang time of the ball to try and give a probability of success to each play in the data set.
Our results were well in line with intuition
